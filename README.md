### Preface
The Airline Recommender project is a collaborative effort from my team, and me. This was part of academic course project for CSCI-B 565 Data Mining at Indiana University Bloomington taught by Prof. Yuzhen Ye.

### Introduction

The airline recommender system is a recommender system where the system recommends whether to fly with the airline service according to the previous feedback of travelers and their experiences. 

The project also focuses on the airline perspective, where they can introspect their services and make a better experience for the passengers by visualizing the various ratings and recommendations by the passengers.
